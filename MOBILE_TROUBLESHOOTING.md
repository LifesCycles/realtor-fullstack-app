## 🌐 Wireless Debugging Setup

### Network Requirements
- Both host PC and mobile device must be connected to the same wireless network
- Ensure stable and consistent network connection

### Android Device Preparation
1. **Enable Developer Options**
   - Go to Settings > About Phone
   - Tap "Build Number" 7 times to unlock Developer Options

2. **Enable Wireless Debugging**
   - Go to Settings > Developer Options
   - Enable "Wireless debugging"
   - Note the pairing code and IP address when prompted

### Capacitor Configuration
- The project is pre-configured for wireless debugging
- Supports dynamic IP detection for local development
- Fallback mechanisms in place for different network scenarios

### Common Troubleshooting Steps
- Verify both devices are on the same network
- Restart wireless debugging on the Android device
- Ensure Capacitor and Android Studio are synchronized
- Check firewall and network security settings

### Potential Issues
- **IP Detection Failures**: 
  - Manually specify network interface if automatic detection fails
  - Check network adapter settings

- **Connection Timeouts**: 
  - Verify network stability
  - Restart development server
  - Reconnect wireless debugging

### Performance Optimization
- Use wired debugging for initial setup
- Minimize network latency for smooth development experience
